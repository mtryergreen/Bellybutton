I learned to connect the HTML file with the other files necessary to customize and upload data via the <script src function, which was very useful. I attached more files that I needed to, probably, due to some general confusion around the dynamics of the files' cooperation.

I also learned to create a local server via python via **python -m http.server** that can load .json files into the browser.
